Given a set of trucks(robots/salesman) and farmers (cities), we modeled travelling salesman problem to help farmers to take commodities(virtual) from farmers place to cold storage. 
We built a decentralized system in which farmers can contact near by truck(robots) by direct communication or through neighbors. 
Truck(robots) may deny/accept the new request based on current status  e.g capacity. 
Developed programs using Java and LEGO kits for robot.
